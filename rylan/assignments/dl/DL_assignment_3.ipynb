The images have a resolution of $28\\times 28$ pixels. This is the same dataset as in Assignment 1, but we will be using this data a bit differently this time around. Since this assignment will be focusing on recurrent networks that model sequential data, we will be looking at each image as a sequence: the networks you train will be \"reading\" the image one row at a time, from top to bottom (we could even do pixel-by-pixel, but in the interest of time we'll do row-by-row which is faster).  Also, we will work with a binarized version of MNIST -- we constrain the values of the pixels to be either $0$ or $1$. You can do this by applying the method `binarize`, defined below, to the raw images.\n",

In this assignment and the following one we will look at two of these forms: **many-to-one** (sequence to label/decision) and the **many-to-many** scenario where the model receives an input and produces an output at every time step. You will use these to solve the following tasks: i) classification (*this homework*), ii) pixel prediction (*next homework*) and iii) in-painting (*next homework*).\n",
